# Statistical and ML models performance evaluation
This artifact defines the most robust model for long-term predictions by conducting a simulation study and comparing the results of the experiments.

# In order to run a simulation, follow these 7 steps:

In order to run a simulation, follow these steps:
1) make sure all the libraries from requirements.txt file are installed in your environment
2) clone this repository to your local environment
3) open simulation-model/Main.py with a text editor (I am using Atom.io)
4) define the settings for a simulation
5) open a terminal in a folder simulation-model and type in python Main.py
6) wait for the simulation model to output the results
